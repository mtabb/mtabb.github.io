                        <h3>Godzilla</h3>
                        <h4>King of the Monsters</h4>
                        <p>Godzilla was explained to be an ancient life form of a Irradiated Prehistoric Amphibious Reptile/Godzillasaurus from the Permian period, having survived various extinction events by consuming geothermal radiation in a hibernation-like state at the bottom of the sea until being awakened in 1954 by a nuclear submarine.Godzilla was  the alpha predator of his ecosystem, and prevented the other species from overpopulating and overrunning the world, acting as a force of nature that maintained balance.Godzilla is the most powerful of Earth's Defenders. Godzilla lives beneath the ocean's waves, slumbering until he is called upon to face some fearsome threat. Although he has often defended the Earth from aliens, mutants, and other external threats.Not soft, but morally good. When forced into combat though, he's easily one of the most dangerous kaiju of all time, both from raw power and using his wits to his advantage. Still if he can avoid conflict though he'll try to take the more peaceful route unless he thinks the opposing party can't be trusted. If attacked however, he will not hesitate to use force to fight back.</p>

                        <h3>Mothra Lea</h3>
                        <h4>The Guardian of Mortals</h4>
                        <p>Mothra was the ancient race of  Mystical Deity resembling a giant guardian Divine moth that protecting all life on Earth from threats.Starting from an egg, it grew into a larva, cocooned, and became an imago before ultimately maturing into its current colossal state.Mothra is a paragon of benevolence, being the brains and heart of the benign Terran kaiju forces. She is as clever as she is caring, and has more than enough bravery to put both to use defending what she holds dear.  This makes her arguably the most morally good of the 'Big Four', reigning in any rage or irrationality amongst her allies.</p>

                        <h3>Anguirus</h3>
                        <h4>The Fire Guardian</h4>
                        <p>Anguirus is a  Mystically created hybrid, derived from an Ankylosaurus that lived around the same time as Godzilla. Like Godzilla, Anguirus managed to survive into the modern day by lying dormant somewhere, presumably underwater, before being awakened and irradiated by nuclear bomb tests in the 1950's.Anguirus is a loyal Earth Defender. Although he is neither the largest, strongest, or fastest of Earth's vanguard, he possesses a tenacity of spirit that makes him a fearsome opponent for any monster.Rough around the edges, but means well. Being a guardian monster he never was especially malign, though he has a tendency to act very gruff at times. Still, to his allies he is very steadfast and loyal. When in combat he'll very rarely give up, no matter the odds against him and is often said to have a 'Never say die' attitude.When the earth is threatened,Godzilla will come to its defense-and Anguirus will be right beside him, until the end. </p>

                        <h3>Rodan</h3>
                        <h4>The Supersonic Phoenix</h4>
                        <p>Rodan is a Mystically and Genetically engineered Irradiated Pterosaur from Mesozoic era.His element is the air, the clouds, and the wind-swept mountain peaks that scrape against them.Nesting in the tops of active volcanoes,Rodan is virtually immune to heat and lava-based attacks. Rodan is the fastest of all monsters while in the air, and prefers to confront challenges from a lofty height. His great speed also makes him a fierce hand-to-hand combatant, with savage claw, talon, and beak attacks.Rodan defends the Earth's atmosphere - eliminating all airborne threats to the planet's well-being. Rodan often keeps himself amicable and laid back. A free bird, he hates to get tied down too much and simply despises being in a cramped area. If you give him or others no trouble, he'll give you no trouble. That said, push him and his head gets as hot as his uranium beam. The rookie of the 'Big Four', he tends to be a bit rash with his decisions and is a bit rebellious. But in the end of the day, if he knows it's time to get serious, you'll have his full attention.</p>
